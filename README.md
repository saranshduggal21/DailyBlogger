# DailyBlogger
- Constructed an app using React Native that allows users to create, read, edit and delete blog posts.
- Created resuable components and used the useContext hook in order to make code as efficient as possible.
- I also built a Node.js server that stores all blog posts, along with a REST API to access and use data from the server through asynchronous JSON requests.
